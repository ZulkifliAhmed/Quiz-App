Through this project, I learned a range of essential skills, including:

How to use fetch to retrieve data from an external JSON file or an API.

Using async/await to handle asynchronous operations.

Creating and using functions, and passing parameters to them.

Working with variables and updating their values as needed.

Manipulating the DOM, including creating and removing elements using JavaScript.

Using conditional statements to control the program flow based on user answers.

This project helped reinforce my understanding of JavaScript programming concepts, especially in building interactive, data-driven applications.
